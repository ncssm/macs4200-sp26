    "## Writing functions\n",
    "There are several tasks that you'll need to complete frequently throughout this course when working with text. In this lab, you'll learn how to write a function to complete these tasks so you don't need to copy, paste, and modify your computer code each time you want to slightly modify the parameters of the task at hand. You'll write functions to help perform the following tasks:\n",
    "* `text_clean`: This function will accept a string as an input, and return a string that only contains characters in the alphabet you're using\n",
    "* `text_block`: Ciphertext is traditionally displayed as upper-case letters grouped into blocks of 5 characters. This function will accept a string and return the same string grouped in blocks of 5 characters with a single space between the blocks\n",
    "* `caesar`: This function will accept a string and encrypt or decrypt it using the Caesar cipher, and return a string with the result\n",
    "* `gcd`: This function will accept two integers as inputs and use the Euclidean Algorithm to determine the greatest common divisor, which it will return as an integer"

    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use python to encrypt messages, we want our input text to be predictable so we can provide instructions to the computer that we know will work with the provided input. That often means we need to \"clean\" our plaintext before encryption. We often want to strip out punctuation and spaces, and ensure that all the characters are part of the alphabet we're using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function named `text_clean` with arguments:\n",
    "* `text`: a string containing the text to clean\n",
    "* `LETTERS` (optional argument, default value `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`): a string that defines the valid alphabet\n",
    "* `match_case` (optional argument, default value `False`): a boolean that decides if the function should act is if `'A'` and `'a'` should count as the same character or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should check each character in `text` to see if is in the string `LETTERS`. If it is, the character should be kept in the output of the function. If it is not, it should not be in the output of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> text_clean('Hello')\n",
    "\"HELLO\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> text_clean('Hello', match_case=True)\n",
    "\"H\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> text_clean(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\"HELLOWORLD\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> text_clean(\"a1b2c3\", LETTERS=\"0123456789\")\n",
    "\"123\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You should not use the `.replace` string method to remove unwanted characters from `text`. This would require you, the programmer, to construct a *deny-list* of invalid characters. Users of your function will likely be very good at coming up with invalid characters you didn't think of putting on your deny-list. Instead, check to see if the characters in `text` are in `LETTERS`, you're using an *allow-list* approach, which is much easier to use to create a valid string."
