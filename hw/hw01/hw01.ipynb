    "Use the provided functions to complete the `affine` function below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `affine` should have arguments:\n",
    "* `text`: a string that contains a message to encrypt or decrypt. You should assume this string is not \"clean\"\n",
    "* `m_key`: an integer that will be used as the multiplicative encryption key\n",
    "* `a_key`: an integer that will be used as the additive key\n",
    "* `decrypt` (optional argument set to `False`): a boolean value (e.g. True or False) that determines if the function encrypts a message (`decrypt = False`) or decrypts a message (`decrypt = True`).\n",
    "* `LETTERS` (optional argument, default value `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`): the alphabet that is considered valid for the message\n",
    "\n",
    "The `affine` function should return either:\n",
    "* an encrypted ciphertext message as an upper-case and blocked string (when `decrypt=False`)\n",
    "* a decrypted plaintext message as a lowercase string (when `decrypt=True`)\n",
