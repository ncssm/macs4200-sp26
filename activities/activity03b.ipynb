    "\n",

    "### String Methods to Consider Using\n",
    "* `.upper()` - makes all letters uppercase\n",
    "* `.lower()` - makes all letters lowercase\n",
    "* `.title()` - capitalizes first letter of each word\n",
    "* `.capitalize()` - capitalizes first letter of the string\n",
    "* `.strip()` - removes extra spaces from ends\n",
    "* `.split()` - breaks string into parts\n",
    "* `.join()` - combines strings together\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Success\n",
    "* First, try each string method separately to see what it does and how it works\n",
    "* Print your results often to check your work\n",
    "* Use well-named variables, whose names describe the type of data they hold\n",
    "* **Remember**: strings can be added together (concatenated) using the + operator \n",
    "* **Remember**: strings can be repeated many times using the * operator \n"
