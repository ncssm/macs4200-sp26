    "Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org) is a website that hosts the world’s great literature, with focus on older works for which U.S. copyright has expired. As such, it provides legal access to thousands of books, many of which are stored in a .txt file that can be imported into your Python workflow.\n",

    "1. **Choose a book to work with**. Navigate to the Top 100 downloaded books section (https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top) and find a book that calls to you. Click on the list for the book to load the information page for that specific book.\n",
    "2. **Download a copy of the book** You'll see that each book is available in a few different formats. You could view in HTML (for your web browser), EPUB (for your eBook reader), or Plain Text UTF-8 (a .txt file for your Python notebook). You should right click on the link for the Plain Text UTF-8 .txt file and save it to your local computer. You can open it on your computer to verify it downloaded correctly, it should open in Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac).\n",
    "3. **Upload the text file to the activities folder.** Put the `.txt` file in the same folder as this `activity11.ipynb` file on Datahub.\n",
    "4. **In the cell below, load the text in the text of your chosen book as a string** Refer back to Lab 03 to see how to do this."
